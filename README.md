# Project Details

## Project Title: Check in/ Check out system

## Problem Statement:
A company was facing issues with keeping track of its employees’ activity and attendance at work. They still relied on paper-based logs so that left a lot of room for human errors, false reports, misplaced errors and what matters most it was an every-day time consuming process. Without an automated system, the company was prone to unauthorized check-in and false logs. Also, management struggles to make analytics about an employee’s attendance at work, tardiness or day-offs due to the absence of historical data or loss of papers through the time.

## Solution Proposed:
To address the problem of the current manual system, we suggest a Check in/ Check out system application that ensures no bypass, accurate tracking and enhanced security that also leads to fair payroll for all employees at the end of the month regarding their regular attendance, tardiness, days off, sick leave, overtime etc.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** This project will assist with automating the access management efficiently to reduce manual errors, improve the record accuracy through secure user authentication and providing real-time tracking and reporting

- **Main Objectives:**
1. Minimize manual logging and administrative efforts
2. Create a user-friendly application for easy access and management
3. Improve security and access control
4. Enable real-time monitoring and data accuracy
5. Automate the check-in/check-out process

## Application Description:

#### **Requirements**
- User registration and authentication
- Attendance/activity tracking
- Automated check-in/check-out
- User-friendly interface

#### **Features**
- User Account Management: Users can log in and manage their profiles.
- Homepage: Selecting whether you are a simple user or admin
- Attendance History: Users can see and export historical records of their check-ins and check-outs from work.
- Change Credentials: Users can issue a request to the management to change username, password or email.
- Employee Management: Admin can add, update or delete an employee's information from the record table.
- Search function: Search for a specific employee through filters.
- Tracking: Admin can track the attendance of all employees.
- Request Form: Admin can accept or decline user's request to change credentials.

#### **Intended Users**
- Employees & staff
- Administrators & managers

#### **Limitations**

# Phase II: User Requirements and Application Specifications
## 1.	Chosen Development Model
For this project, we chose to follow the Agile development model due to its flexibility, adaptability and iterative approach. The reason behind selecting this model is that agile allows for continuous improvement through iterative cycles and getting feedback from the stakeholders allows the system to align with their needs. Being tolerant to adaptability, it allows for frequent and quick adjustments and not to mention that is less prone to risks of major failures since it has early testing and follows an incremental development.
## 2.	User Requirements
#### **a. Stakeholders**
- Employees (end-users) – they will use the system to check in and check out so what they need is a comprehensive, accurate and efficient system
- Managers - what they are looking for is real-time monitoring  and reports so they can supervise the users’ attendance and activity
- IT department - they are aiming to have secure access control and system scalability because they will be responsible for maintaining the system and dealing with troubleshooting
- HR team - based on users’ attendance, they will calculate payroll
- Business owners - they have the final word about approving the system implementation and budget
#### **b. User Stories**
| User Type | User Story | Requirement | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| End-user | “As an end user, I want to check in quickly using my QR code, so that I don’t waste time in long queues or manual logbooks.” | The system should provide a QR code scanning identification, Instant logging of check-in time | Time-efficient, Reduces human error |


| Manager | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
| HR manager | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
