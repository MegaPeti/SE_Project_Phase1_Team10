# Project Details

## Project Title: Check in/ Check out system

## Problem Statement:
A company was facing issues with keeping track of its employees’ activity and attendance at work. They still relied on paper-based logs so that left a lot of room for human errors, false reports, misplaced errors and what matters most it was an every-day time consuming process. Without an automated system, the company was prone to unauthorized check-in and false logs. Also, management struggles to make analytics about an employee’s attendance at work, tardiness or day-offs due to the absence of historical data or loss of papers through the time.

## Solution Proposed:
To address the problem of the current manual system, we suggest a Check in/ Check out system application that ensures no bypass, accurate tracking and enhanced security that also leads to fair payroll for all employees at the end of the month regarding their regular attendance, tardiness, days off, sick leave, overtime etc.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** This project will assist with automating the access management efficiently to reduce manual errors, improve the record accuracy through secure user authentication and providing real-time tracking and reporting

- **Main Objectives:**
1. Minimize manual logging and administrative efforts
2. Create a user-friendly application for easy access and management
3. Improve security and access control
4. Enable real-time monitoring and data accuracy
5. Automate the check-in/check-out process
