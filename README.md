# Project Details

## Project Title: Check in/ Check out system

## Problem Statement:
A company was facing issues with keeping track of its employees’ activity and attendance at work. They still relied on paper-based logs so that left a lot of room for human errors, false reports, misplaced errors and what matters most it was an every-day time consuming process. Without an automated system, the company was prone to unauthorized check-in and false logs. Also, management struggles to make analytics about an employee’s attendance at work, tardiness or day-offs due to the absence of historical data or loss of papers through the time.
